<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Currently self employed, developing quantitative finance systems and involved as a consultant with a healthcare startup. I do have a fair amount of experience, with more than couple of decades working
   in global organisations.  Presently re-igniting my passion for coding with a decent command on Python, I am getting my feet wet with JavaScript aimed  
   to create apealing UI/UX for a proof of concept web application. Some day soon I hope to start a small setup to help simple people 
  in my town understand the nuances of debt and investing. </p>

<p>By living in a town away from the hustle bustle of the city life I have been used to, I have turned my life around to be better disciplined, simple and
  balanced. Most of all appreciating every moment spending with my dad. I love spending spare time doing DIY projects, listening music and reading. 
  Keeping absolutely absolutely minimal TV and Online engagements during "me time".
</p>

<p>Also adopted a canine from the streets, who has turned out to be an absolutely adorable companion. Intelligent, smart and unconditional
  affection. He keeps an eye on our yard.
